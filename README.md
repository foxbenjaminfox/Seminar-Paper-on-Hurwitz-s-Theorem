#My Seminar Paper on Hurwitz's Theorem

This is my seminar paper that I wrote as part of my bachelor's degree at the Open University of Israel.

Any mistakes or omissions are mine, although I have strived to make it as accurate and complete as possible. If you find any errors, feel free to open an issue on Github.
